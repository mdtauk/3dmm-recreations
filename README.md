# 3D Movie Maker - recreation bits

Growing up in the late 90's will leave you with many nostalgic memories.  For me, one of those was the fun of using
**Microsoft 3D Movie Maker**.

As the years have passed, there are a few who have sought to reverse engineer, and expand on what is capable with the software.

As the file formats have been figured out, and as others are developing ways to render these movies in higher resolutions.  We are at a stage where it is possible to convert the Camera data from the scenes into cameras within 3D software packages, which will make it easier to recreate the static pre-rendered scenes that feature in the software, at higher resolutions.

In time I hope tools will be developed to create new angles for existing scenes, and new scenes all together!

So here is a little repository for those interested in getting involved in this work.

### If anyone is interested in helping out, it would be appreciated.
